2048
To play 2048, swipe tiles on a 4x4 grid to move them in one of four directions (up, down, left, or right). When two tiles with the same number collide, they merge into a new tile with double the value. The goal is to combine tiles to reach the 2048 tile, but you can continue playing beyond that to achieve higher scores. A new tile (usually a 2, sometimes a 4) appears after each move.
